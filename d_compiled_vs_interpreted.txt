Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, resulting in faster performance. Examples include C and C++.

Interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter, which makes them easier to debug and more portable, but generally slower. Examples include Python and JavaScript.

Python is an interpreted language, meaning its code is executed by an interpreter at runtime rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.
